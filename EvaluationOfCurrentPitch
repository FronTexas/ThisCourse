- Analyze rhetoric of the pitch
	// TODO Analyze our pitch's Time orientations, Persuasive appeals, or the structure of logical appeals
		- Time orientations
			- The past
				Example: “Because our business grew unexpectedly in 2012, we had to outsource some production to partners. We were able to meet demand, but quality measures suffered, damaging our reputation.”
				- Traditional lecture

			- The present (What is happening?)
				Example: “As a result, our customer satisfaction ratings have dropped to unsustainable levels. Our market lead is eroding.”
				- Compromises a lot of stuff:
					- Taking notes is a good way to be 2 minutes behind
					- Prof pace is not suitable with students learning capacity
					- Notes can loose context
					- Absences
					- Once lecture over then its over
			- The future
				Example: “If we do not address this problem, we will lose our leadership in the market. ...I recommend establishing rigid QA guidelines that must be met when we outsource.”
				- If we staying this way students will keep losing a lot of values from their lecture that they've been paying
				- What are the things that student missed by having these problem above:
					- Money
					- Time
					- They can become anxious
					- They're not really owning their learning resources
					- Cannot make the teaching style optimal for their learning style and or pace
		- Persuasive appeals
			- Logos (Logic)
				- We need to make a claim about our product

			- Pathos (emotion)
				- Is our presentation relatable to the audience i.e. the students
				- Determine the mood of our pitch between: Passion,Charismatic,excitement,fear,worry,outrage
			- Ethos (authority, affiliation, credentials)
				- Put some credentials(?)
				- Put some expereince (?)
				- Put tech buzzword/jargon
